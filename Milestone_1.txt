This milestone is aiming at having complete User Interface:
-Main Menu
-Level Selector
-Crafting Panel
-Character Progression Panel

Also there should be a test room for game mechanics and features evaluation.
At this milestone it should support:
-Character frame independent movement, attacking, jumping, dying, respawning
and level uping.
-World props destruction.
-Possibly a basic AI to test your attacks on lel.
